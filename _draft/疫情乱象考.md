## 药品考

Currently, available oral analogs of remdesivir are GS-621763, VV116, and ATV006.

Paxlovid - China had approved only one oral antiviralto treatthe disease, Paxlovid, developed by Pfizer in New York City. It is highly effective — it reduces the risk of hospitalization and death by nearly 89%.


VV116 - a pill version of the intravenous drug remdesivir. Another Chinese-made oral antiviral, VV116, is in the final stages of development, and another dozen are in various stages of development. Shanghai Junshi Biosciences slightly tweaked the remdesivir formula and was granted a patent to manufacture it as a pill. It is already being used in Uzbekistan.

remdesivir - made by Gilead Sciences in Foster City, California, and the first drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating COVID-19.

VV116 also blocks viral replication and, like Azvudine and Paxloivd, works best when taken soon after infection.
